# `useRef()`

:::info

For class components, use [`createRef()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#creating-refs) instead.

:::

## What Is `useRef()`?

`useRef()` is a built-in [hook](./the-basics-of-hooks) that takes an argument of any type and returns a **reference** of that value. In React, a "reference" is **a non-reactive JavaScript object whose value can persist across render cycles**.

For example, consider the following code:

```tsx showLineNumbers
export const Example = () => {
  // highlight-next-line
  let count = 0

  const increment = () => {
    // highlight-next-line
    count++
  }

  return (
    // ...
  )
}
```

In the above example, as we've exlpained in [Component Rendering](./component-rendering#what-happens-when-a-component-re-renders), `count` will be reset back to `0` whenever `Example` re-renders because `count` is redefined within every render. With the help of `useRef()`, we now have a way to persist a non-reactive value across render cycles:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { useRef } from 'react'

export const Example = () => {
  // highlight-next-line
  const count = useRef(0)

  return (
    // ...
  )
}
```

In the above example, the value of `count` will **not** be reset back to `0` whenever `Example` re-renders.

However, since a reference is non-reactive, updating it will **not** cause the component to re-render. Besides, unlike state, the update of a reference is immediate â€” we don't have to wait until the next render to get the updated value. This makes `useRef()` a good choice for situations where you want to preserve a value between renders, but you also don't want the component to re-render when the value changes.

More importantly, **a reference will always give you the latest value, even in a memoized function**. Take [`useCallback()`](./optimization-functions#usecallback) as an example:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { useRef, useCallback } from 'react'

// highlight-next-line
const name = useRef('hello')

const logName = useCallback(() => {
  // highlight-next-line
  console.log(name.current)
}, [])
```

In this example, even if `logName()` is being memoized by a `useCallback()` with no dependency, the `name.current` in `logName()` will still point to the latest value of `name`. The same rule can be applied to `useEffect()` and `useMemo()` as well.

:::caution

Please beware that since a reference is non-reactive, any effect (`useEffect()`, `useMemo()`, or `useCallback()`) depends on this value will **not** get computed after changes, unless any other value in the same dependency array is being changed at the same time. For example:

- In the example below, no side effect will be executed, no matter how many times `name.current` changes:
  ```ts showLineNumbers
  import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'

  const name = useRef('hello')

  useEffect(() => {
    // This effect will not be executed after `name.current` changes.
  // highlight-next-line
  }, [name.current])
  ```
- In the example below, side effect will not be executed after `name.current` changes, but it **will** be executed after `age` changes!
  ```ts showLineNumbers
  import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react'

  const [age, setAge] = useState(0)
  const name = useRef('hello')

  useEffect(() => {
    // This effect will not be executed after `name.current` changes,
    // but it will be executed after `age` changes!
  // highlight-next-line
  }, [age, name.current])
  ```

Simply put, **putting a reference into a dependency array (of an effect) is meaningless**.

:::

## `MutableRefObject<T>`

The returned type of `useRef()` is `MutableRefObject<T>`. A simple interface for `MutableRefObject<T>` would look like this:

```ts showLineNumbers
interface MutableRefObject<T> {
  current: T
}
```

A `MutableRefObject<T>` contains only **one** value of any type, so you can have:

- `MutableRefObject<number>`
- `MutableRefObject<number[]>`
- `MutableRefObject<{ id: number, name: string }>`
- `MutableRefObject<Promise<() => void>>`
- ...anything you need!

Here's a simple example of `useRef()`:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { useRef } from 'react'

const name = useRef('hello')

console.log(name) // { current: 'hello' }
```

## Update a `MutableRefObject<T>`

To update a `MutableRefObject<T>`, we can simply do it in the classic JavaScript way:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { useRef } from 'react'

const name = useRef('hello')
console.log(name.current) // 'hello'

// highlight-next-line
name.current = 'world'
console.log(name.current) // 'world'
```

The same rule applies to any type of reference, for example:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { useRef } from 'react'

// array
const fruits = useRef(['apple', 'banana'])
console.log(fruits.current) // ['apple', 'banana']

// highlight-next-line
fruits.current[0] = 'cherry'
console.log(fruits.current) // ['cherry', 'banana']

// object
const user = useRef({
  name: 'hello'
  age: 5,
})
console.log(user.current) // { name: 'hello', age: 5 }

// highlight-next-line
user.current.name = 'world'
console.log(user.current) // { name: 'world', age: 5 }
```

##  Examples

Below here we'll list some commonly seen cases where we think `useRef()` may come in handy.

### DOM Nodes

You can get the instance of any DOM node by binding it to a `MutableRefObject<T>`. For example:

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react'

export const Example = () => {
  // highlight-next-line
  const input = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)

  const changeValue = () => {
    // highlight-start
    if (input.current) {
      input.current.value += 'hello'
      console.log(input.current)
    }
    // highlight-end
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* highlight-next-line */}
      <input ref={input} />
      <button onClick={changeValue}>Change value</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

By putting a `MutableRefObject<T>` in the `ref` attribute of a DOM node, you'll be able to manipulate [Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) object in a vanilla JavaScript way. Notice that we must use `null` as the initial value of reference if the target is a DOM node.

<Video src="/video/react/use-ref_html-element.mov" />

However, you should **only use this when standard props/states cannot fulfill your requirements**. For example, calculating the width/height of a DOM node, or focusing on a specific `<input>`.

### Component Instances

:::info

By default this only works on the instance of a class component. If you wish to achieve the same functionality on the instance of a function component, use [`useImperativeHandle()`](./forward-ref#useimperativehandle) instead.

:::

Similar to DOM nodes, you can get the instance of any child-class component by binding it to a `MutableRefObject<T>`. For example:

```tsx title="Parent.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { useRef } from 'react'
  // highlight-next-line
import { Child } from './Child'

export const Parent = () => {
  // `Child` is a class component
  // highlight-next-line
  const child = useRef<Child>(null)

  const makeChilGetOld = () => {
  // highlight-next-line
    child.current?.getOld()
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* highlight-next-line */}
      <Child ref={child} />
      <button onClick={makeChilGetOld}>Make Child Get Old</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx title="Child.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { Component } from 'react'

interface IChildProps {}

interface IChildState {
  age: number
}

export class Child extends Component<IChildProps, IChildState> {
  constructor(props: IChildProps) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      age: 5,
    }
  }

  getOld = () => {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      ...prevState,
      age: prevState.age + 1,
    }))
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, I am {this.state.age} years old</h1>
  }
}
```

<Video src="/video/react/use-ref_component-instance.mov" />

In this example:

- Even though we didn't define a prop called `ref` in `Child`, we can still use it without any issue because that part is already covered when we extends `Component`.
- `Child` is a class component with state `{ age: number }`, and a method `getOld()` to increment `this.state.age`.
- After using reference to get the instance of `Child` in `Parent`, we can call the `getOld()` method in `Child` by clicking the "Make Child Get Old" button in `Parent`.

<details>
  <summary>
    Will it work if we explicitly define a <code>ref</code> prop in <code>Child</code>?
  </summary>

  **Unfortunately, no**. If we explicitly define a `ref` prop in any component, React will ignore that property and give us `undefined`. The only way to get the `ref` being passed down from parent is to use [`forwardRef()`](./forward-ref).
</details>

If you tried to `console.log(child.current)` in `Parent`, you'll see the instance of `Child`:

<img src="/img/react/use-ref_component-instance.png" alt="Value of the instance of class component" />

Since everything is now exposed to parent component, you should be very careful when dealing with this instance; even calling `setState()` for children (from parent component) is now doable (but that's a terrible idea!).

Same as creating references of DOM nodes, you should **only do this when standard props/states cannot fulfill your requirements**, which usually happens when you try to integrate 3rd party components into your app.

### Uncontrolled Components

For most of the time, developers use `useState()` for everything related to form (i.e. `<input>`, `<textarea>`, rich text editor, etc.). However, depending on how states are being used, sometimes `useRef()` could be a better choice. For example:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { useState, FormEvent, ChangeEvent } from 'react'

export const Example = () => {
    // highlight-next-line
  const [name, setName] = useState('')

  const submit = async (e: FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    // Use `name` to do anything you want.
    // highlight-next-line
    console.log(name)
  }

  const handleChange = (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const { value } = e.target
    // highlight-next-line
    setName(value)
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={submit}>
      <input onChange={handleChange} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

In this example, we use `useState()` to declare `name`, and use `setName()` to update the value of `name`. This works fine, but we would actually recommend using `useRef()` instead of `useState()`, because:

- `name` is not being displayed on the screen.
- `name` is not in the dependency array of any effect.
- We didn't make `<input>` into a controlled component. In other words, the value of `<input>` is not affected (controlled) by `name`.
- Since `name` is a state, updating it will cause the component to re-render. This means every time a character is entered, all unmemoized children (child component) will be re-rendered, leading to poor performance. Sometimes even `onBlur` won't save you.

For these reasons, we can say it's safe to replace `useState()` with `useRef()` in this case for better performance while keeping the same functionality:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { useRef, FormEvent, ChangeEvent } from 'react'

export const Example = () => {
    // highlight-next-line
  const name = useRef('')

  const submit = async (e: FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    // Use `name.current` to do anything you want.
    // highlight-next-line
    console.log(name)
  }

  const handleChange = (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const { value } = e.target
    // highlight-next-line
    name.current = value
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={submit}>
      <input onChange={handleChange} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

### Keeping Value for Later Use

Sometimes we would want to share a value between two different life-cycles, usually a function that comes from 3rd party libraries, or an id returned by `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`. For example:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import SomeRandomLibrary from 'some-random-library'

interface IExampleProps {
  something: string
}

// highlight-next-line
export const Example = ({ something }: IExampleProps) => {

  useEffect(() => {
    // highlight-next-line
    const thatFunction = SomeRandomLibrary.init(something)
  }, [])
  
  const doSomething = () => {
    // This won't work because `thatFunction` does not exist here.
    // highlight-next-line
    thatFunction()
  }
  
  return (
    <button onClick={doSomething}>
      Click Me
    </button>
  )
}
```

In this example:

- `SomeRandomLibrary.init()` is a method that initializes the library (usually asynchronous).
- `SomeRandomLibrary.init()` will return a function, which is expected to be called every time the button is clicked.
- `SomeRandomLibrary.init()` depends on a prop `something`; considering there will probably be multiple instances of this component with different props, it makes more sense to initialize them individually.

Here, we call `SomeRandomLibrary.init()` after the component is mounted, which is the most reasonable timing for initialization. The most obvious solution would be to move `SomeRandomLibrary.init()` in `doSomething()` so that we can access `thatFunction()` right after the initialization is done. However, since `SomeRandomLibrary.init()` is used to initialize the library, calling it multiple times may lead to unwanted results like waste of resources or errors. Therefore, the most appropriate way would be to store `thatFunction()` in a variable so that we can access it later. But how can we do this?

We want to make sure each component instance has its own `thatFunction()`, but we also don't want the component to re-render just because `thatFunction()` is stored in a variable. Thus, `useRef()` would be a better option than `useState()` because updating a `MutableRefObject<T>` will not cause the component to re-render, but they both works:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import SomeRandomLibrary from 'some-random-library'

interface IExampleProps {
  something: string
}

export const Example = ({ something }: IExampleProps) => {
  // highlight-next-line
  const thatFunction = useRef<() => void>()

  useEffect(() => {
    // highlight-next-line
    thatFunction.crrent = SomeRandomLibrary.init(something)
  }, [])
  
  const doSomething = () => {
    // highlight-next-line
    thatFunction.current?.()
  }
  
  return (
    <button onClick={doSomething}>
      Click Me
    </button>
  )
}
```

Declaring a variable outside the component seems like a solution, but that'll actually make all instances of this component share the same value, which is not something we would like to see:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import SomeRandomLibrary from 'some-random-library'

interface IExampleProps {
  something: string
}

// Be careful!
// All instances of this component will share the same value in this way!
// highlight-next-line
let thatFunction: (() => void) | undefined = undefined

export const Example = ({ something }: IExampleProps) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // highlight-next-line
    thatFunction = SomeRandomLibrary.init(something)
  }, [])
  
  const doSomething = () => {
    // highlight-next-line
    thatFunction?.()
  }
  
  return (
    <button onClick={doSomething}>
      Click Me
    </button>
  )
}
```

## When to `useRef()`?

In short, use `useRef()` when the value will change, and this change do not have to be reflected on the screen. In other words, the change of the value will not affect what users see on the screen; functions always fall in this category.
