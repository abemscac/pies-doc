# Reactive Values

## What Are Reactive Values?

Reactive values means **anything that will cause the component to re-render after being updated**, including:

- Values generated by [`useState()`](./use-state).
- Values generated by [`useReducer()`](./use-reducer).
- Props of a component.

Anything not listed here is non-reactive, so updating it will not cause the component to re-render.

## What Does Render Mean?

In React, "render" means to **run the code in your component from top to bottom, and transform the output JSX elements into a DOM node**. Any subsequent render after the very first render is called **re-render**.

## Examples

### Reactive Values

```tsx showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from 'react'

export const Example = () => {
  // highlight-next-line
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  const increment = () => {
    // highlight-next-line
    setCount(count + 1)
    console.log(count)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, everytime the "Increment" button is clicked, the value of `count` will be incremented by 1. Since `count` is a reactive value, the component will re-render after it gets updated, thus "refreshing" the screen with the latest values.

However, you may have noticed that the value on the screen is always different from the value we see in the console. Good news is, this is not a bug, but it does confuse everyone! We'll explain this when we get to [Component Rendering](./component-rendering), just don't worry about it now.

Also, it's okay if you have no idea what does [`useState()`](./use-state) do. Just keep in mind that updating reactive values will cause the component to re-render and you're good to go!

### Non-Reactive Values

```tsx showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from 'react'

// highlight-next-line
let count = 0

export const Example = () => {
  const increment = () => {
    // highlight-next-line
    count++
    console.log(count)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Video src="/video/react/reactive-values_non-reactive.mov" />

In this example, everytime the "Increment" button is clicked, the value of `count` will be incremented by 1. However, since `count` is **not** a reactive value, updating it will **not** cause the component to re-render, no matter how many times `count` changes.

But be careful, this does not mean the changes of a non-reactive value will never be reflected on the screen! Let's take a look at the following example:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from 'react'

// highlight-next-line
let age = 0

export const Example = () => {
  // highlight-next-line
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  const incrementCount = () => {
    // highlight-next-line
    setCount(count + 1)
  }

  const incrementAge = () => {
    // highlight-next-line
    age++
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
        <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment Count</button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Age: {age}</h1>
        <button onClick={incrementAge}>Increment Age</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Video src="/video/react/reactive-values_both.mov" height="300px" />

In this example, `count` is a reactive value, while `age` is a non-reactive value. Thus:

- Clicking "Increment Count" will update the value of `count`, and the component will re-render.
- Clicking "Increment Age" will update the value of `age`, but the component will **not** re-render.

This is why in the above video, nothing happened when we clicked "Increment Age" for three times, but the screen suddenly went from `Age: 0` to `Age: 3` after "Increment Count" is clicked, which is confusing.

To avoid such problems, we have to choose the correct way to declare variables. A simple rule of thumb would be:

- Make it a reactive when the value **will change**, and **users must be informed of this change on the screen**.
- Otherwise just make it a non-reactive!
