# `ref()` VS `reactive()`

:::caution Prerequisites

You must learn [`ref()`](./ref) and [`reactive()`](./reactive) before getting into this chapter.

:::

*So... which one should I use to declare reactive states, `ref()` or `reactive()`?*

We're finally here! This is probably the most commonly asked question when it comes to Vue 3.

We'll try to answer this question based on the type of argument, but all in all the conclusion is:

- For primitive values, `ref()` is recommended.
- For functions, neither `ref()` nor `reactive()` is recommended; just use `let` or `var` if it isn't constant.
- For any other type of values, either `ref()` or `reactive()` is fine.

## How `ref()` and `reactive()` Work

In order to know how to choose between `ref()` and `reactive()`, it's essential to know how they work respectively.

### How `ref()` Works

The following pseudocode gives us a good concept of how `ref()` works in Vue 3. Although it is extremely simplified and rearranged, we can still get some ideas of what's going on inside `ref()`:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { reactvie, Ref } from 'vue'

function ref(arg) {
  if (arg is Ref) {
    return arg
  } else {
    return new RefImpl(arg)
  }
}

class RefImp<T> implements Ref<T> {
  public value: T

  constructor(arg: T) {
    if (arg is primitive value) {
      this.value = arg
      track(this.value)
    } else {
      this.value = reactive(arg)
    }
  }
}
```

- As we've mentioned before, `RefImpl` is a class with only one public property `value`.
- If the argument is a primitive value, `RefImpl` will use it as `this.value` and track the changes so that reactivity can be fulfilled.
- If the argument is not a primitive value, `RefImpl` will just call `reactive()` and use the returned value as `this.value`.

### How `reactive()` Works

The following pseudocode gives us a good concept of how `reactive()` works in Vue 3. It's not exactly the same as the source code, but it's close enough to let us know what's going on inside `reactive()`:

```ts showLineNumbers
function reactive(arg) {
  if (arg is primitive value) {
    if (is in development mode) {
      console.warn(`value cannot be made reactive: ${String(arg)}`)
    }
    return arg
  } else if (arg is reactive OR arg is function) {
    return arg
  } else {
    return reactive version of arg
  }
}
```

- As we've mentioned before, `reactive()` only works with non-primitive values.
- `reactive()` doesn't work with functions, even if functions are not primitive values.
- The "reactive version of arg" actually means a `Proxy` object.

## Explanation

Great, now you know how `ref()` and `reactive()` actually work! Now it's time to dive into the most important part â€” explain why we choose `ref()` or `reactive()` over the other based on different type of argument.

### Primitive Values

If the argument is a primitive value, then `ref()` would be the best choice because `reactive()` only works with non-primitive values.

Of course we can just wrap the value into an object like `const age = reactive({ someRandomKey: 5 })`, but... why? Just use `ref()` and you'll get the same result!

### Functions

If the argument is a function, you probably don't want it to be reactive. Function is something that **should not be rendered** on the screen, and it **should not be used to represent the state of a component**, so making it reactive is meaningless.

A common use case of assigning functions to variables is **event subscription/registration**. It's those things we register when component mounts, and we remove them before component unmounts.

Take the [Navigation Guards](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html#global-before-guards) of [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) for example:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { onMounted, onBeforeUnmount } from 'vue'
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router'

const router = useRouter()

// highlight-next-line
let unregisterNavGuard: () => void | undefined = undefined

onMounted(() => {
  // highlight-start
  unregisterNavGuard = router.beforeEach((to, from) => {
    // ...
  })
  // highlight-end
})

onBeforeUnmount(() => {
  // highlight-next-line
  unregisterNavGuard?.()
})
```

1. We register the navigation guard in `onMounted()` by using `router.beforeEach()`.
2. `router.beforeEach()` returns the unregister function.
3. The unregister function should only be called in `onBeforeUnmount()`.
4. After we get the unregister function in step 2, we assign it to a variable called `unregisterNavGuard` and use it in step 3.

We use `let` instead of `ref()` or `reactive()` to declare `unregisterNavGuard` because users don't have to be informed of this change.

If you REALLY want a function to be reactive (which we cannot think of any good reason), `ref()` would be a better choice because `reactive()` will directly returns the argument if it's a function, which means `const func = reactive(() => {})` will be the same as `const func = () => {}`.

### Any Other Type

Anything other than primitive value and function falls into this category. For example, plain object, Array, Map, etc.

In these cases, it doesn't really matter if we use `ref()` or `reactive()`; because from user's perspective (you and me, the developers), the `.value` after `Ref<T>` would be the only difference. For example:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { ref, reactive } from 'vue'

const userA = ref({
  name: 'hello',
})

const userB = reactive({
  name: 'hello'
})

console.log(userA.value) // { name: 'hello' }
console.log(userB) // { name: 'hello' }

userA.value.name = 'world'
userB.name = 'world'

console.log(userA.value) // { name: 'world' }
console.log(userB) // { name: 'world' }
```

Since none is better than the other, either `ref()` or `reactive()` is fine. Just make sure **the whole team/project is using the same rule** when declaring reactive variables and you'll be just fine!
